# How this works

This is the ticket system for Codaisseur Students. 
If you have a question on the project you're working on, make sure you have the following:
1. A link to the Pull Request(PR) (that is marked as work in progress `W.I.P`) with the code that gives you the issue. 
2. A specific question about that code in your PR.
3. Any idea about expected result and actual result

If you need inspiration on how to ask good questions, [this post](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) has your back!

## So, you have what it takes?
